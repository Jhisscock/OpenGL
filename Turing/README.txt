Surprises:
I tryed to include a few different surprises because I got caught up in the project.
First, I made some chords for the machine out of circles that overlapped eachother in a sin wave pattern.
This makes it look like a braided chord and it has turns almost like a real chord would have.
Second, I incorperated particle effects because I found the idea intersting.
They are very basic particles made out of 4 quads each with a texture mapped onto them with a green color applied over the texture.
As the quads fall through the air the texture moves as well almost in a scan line type of pattern.
I did this because I wanted to emulate a matrix like coding area in my project space.
Then lastly these are mainly notable things that I did not know if they would be considered "surpirises" or not.
I applied an animation the the knobs on the machine so that they rotate like they would in real life.
Also I made a skybox for the project wich puts you in a space surronded by code.
This is simply done by applying textures to very large quads.

Notes:
To control the camera you use the arrow keys, I could not figure out how to make it go up and down.
I tried to put eck's camera api on top of this one so you could move and look around but they conflicted with each other for reasons I still do not know.
